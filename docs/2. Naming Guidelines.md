# Naming Guidelines

## Packages
Packages will always be written in lowercase with no underscores
```java
package com.carbonlollipop.ladder.playermain.info;
```
## Classes
Classes are PascalCase
```java
public class SampleClass {
    // Members
}
```

## Enumerators
Enums are UPPERCASE
```java
enum SAMPLEENUM {
    // Values
}
```

## Methods
 - Methods are camelCase **where** applicable
 - Event methods are written in PascalCase and have the same name as the event type they take as a paremeter
```java
public void SampleMethod() {
    // Code
}

@EventHandler
public static void PlayerDeathEvent(PlayerDeathEvent event) {
    // Code
}
```
## Variables

### Fields
 - Public fields are written in PascalCase
 - Private fields are written in camelCase
 - Finals are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
```java
public int PublicMember = 0;
private int _privateMember = 0;
public final int PUBLIC_FINAL_MEMBER = 0;
private final int PRIVATE_FINAL_MEMBER = 0;
```
### Variables
 - Method parameters are written in camelCase
 - Local variables are written in camelCase, favouring brevity
```java
public void SampleMethod(int methodParameter, float otherMethodParameter) {
    // Code
}

public <T> T[] Swap(T[] array) {
    T swap = array[0];
    array[0] = array[1];
    array[1] = swap;
    return array;
}
```
